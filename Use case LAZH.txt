The game is based on the fact that a snake is hungry and would like to eat a rabbit.
The snake and the rabbit starts each in corner on the game board, which is made as a coordinate system.
The snake starts at square 9, 9, and the rabbit starts at square 0, 0. Then the snake and the rabbit will move
towards each other. When the snake and the rabbit are at the same square, the rabbit will exclaim "Do not eat me" 
and the snake will exclaim "haha - I am hungry and I'll eat you anyway".
If this is not the case and they pass each other, then the rabbit will exclaim "I was too fast".
The game is over when they are either at the same square or they have passed each other.
